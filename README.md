## Insights

* The line chart shows how dates affect the average reservation price on Airbnb Washington DC, from December 1, 2022, to December 1, 2023. Units are measured in dollars ($). The average cost from December 2022 to April 2023 will be the lowest compared to other months (about $130 to $145). The average price will peak at $150 on April 1, 2023. Subsequently, the average price will remain stable with a slight fluctuation (around $145-$148) until November 2023, after which it will decline slightly in December 2023. The best days to rent a room on Airbnb in Washington DC at low prices will be between December 2022 and March 2023. Avoid renting a room in April 2023, as it will hit the highest price.

* The horizontal bar chart provides information on the overall number of reviews made from 2009-2022. The chart shows a steady increase from 2009 to 2019, with 11 and 56,927 reviews, respectively. It then dropped to 27,832 reviews in 2020 before returning to the top spot, reaching the highest number of reviews (86,870) in 2022. The total number of reviewers has increased over the years, but the significant decline in 2020 requires further investigation.

* The vertical bar chart illustrates the number of room types in Airbnb, Washington DC. There are four types of rooms: private rooms, shared rooms, and hotel rooms. The most significant number of room types is entire homes/apartments (4,200 units), followed by private rooms (1,389 units), shared rooms (96 units), and hotel rooms (21 units), which is the smallest room type. It is safe to assume that Airbnb, in Washington DC, derives most of its revenue across entire home/apartment types.

* The table gives information about the minimum, maximum and average price per night based on room type in Airbnb Washington DC from December 2022 to December 2023. Units are measured in dollars ($). The entire home/apartment type will offer the lowest booking price ($10) and highest price ($325) in contrast to other room types. The average cost for the entire house/apartment will be $143.3, and the lowest for a shared room will be $47.2. In conclusion, further investigation into other variables will need to be executed since the supply of the entire home/apartment type is the highest, and it will be offered at the highest average price compared to another room type.

* The box chart depicts how many hosts or listings Airbnb Washington DC had in 2022. The total number of hosts was 5,706 units, as shown in the box chart and projected into the map figure. The map figure divides price categories into three different types, such as Cheap (â‰¤ $50), Moderate ($50-$150), and Expensive (> $150). The map is interactive. One can zoom in or out, move freely to another area, and click on the host or legend. Hover over the host region to view host information. Host information includes host id, hostname, host URL, room type, review rating, price category, and price. Consequently, the price distribution per category is easy to determine if someone decides to book at the host by considering its price.
